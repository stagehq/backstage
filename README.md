# Make the setup

### Setup amplify

Before you clone the repo you have to setup amplify.

```sh
yarn global add @aws-amplify/cli
```

When you installed the cli you have to add a amplify profile to your local maschine. The profile represents a iam user. Iam users can be specified with password or accessIds. For amplify we need user with accessIDs, therefore we can't use the existing users. AccessID users were created with the naming convention: 'nils-macbook', so it's clear that it is a machine. It has only amplify-admin access. To create a profile you can use the command:

```sh
amplify configure
```

!Do not create a new user.

Now your profile is stored globally. It's time to clone the repo. Go in the target folder and clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@gitlab.com:homeOfOpenSource/homeofopensource.git
```

Then go in the project folder and enter the following command to check out the dev amplifiy environment. Use your profile and enter the required inputs.

```sh
amplify pull --appId dqjh6lcvjv24j  --envName dev
```

### Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

### run application

```sh
yarn dev
```

We can have multible environments and change them like changing branches with git.

# Bedrock

Welcome to Bedrock! ðŸ‘‹

Before you get started, please **join the community** where you can chat with other folks using Bedrock, ask questions and get help:

https://discord.gg/XKU3jArbm7

## Getting started

### Getting the code

**Please do not clone the repository directly**, as that would defeat the purpose of using Bedrock â€” you don't want all of its git history in your own project.

Instead, **download the "Source code (.zip)" file of [the latest release](https://github.com/mxstbr/bedrock/releases)**. Once that download finishes:

1. Unzip the folder
2. Rename the unzipped folder from `bedrock-x.y.z` to your product's name
3. Open the directory on your terminal and initialize git:

```sh
cd <project>
git init
```

After that, you're ready to get started!

### Initial setup

You'll need certain environment variables to run Bedrock's functionality in local development. The first step is to:

- Sign up for [Stripe](https://stripe.com), used for payments
- Sign up for [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com), used for sending emails

Then, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out the `.env` file with your environment variables!

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

> Note: do not delete the `.env.example` file, as it's used by some code generation processes and is useful for potential future team members as a reference.

Now you're ready to set everything up locally:

1. **Install Docker** by following their [installation instructions for your OS](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Bedrock uses Docker to start the local development database.

2. Then, **install the dependencies** with `yarn`:

```sh
yarn
```

3. **Start the local development database** as well as the Stripe CLI webhook listener (to make payments work) with `docker-compose`:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

4. **Copy the webhook secret** that the Stripe CLI logged, something like "> Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec\_\*\*\*". Copy that secret and add it to your `.env` file.

5. **Migrate your local development database** to the base schema:

```sh
yarn prisma:migrate
```

### Development workflow

To develop your app, you always need to have two commands running concurrently:

1. **Start the development database** with:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

2. **Start the development process**, which also runs all the necessary code generators:

```sh
yarn dev
```

That's it! Now you should have Bedrock running locally and should be able to visit http://localhost:3000 ðŸŽ‰

#### Scripts

The **three most important commands** you'll run frequently during development:

- `yarn generate`: Generates the Prisma client ([docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client)), which Nexus uses and generates the GraphQL schema ([docs](https://nexusjs.org/docs/guides/generated-artifacts)), which GraphQL Codegen uses and generates the urql hooks ([docs](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/plugins/typescript-urql)). Run this whenever you change the database schema, GraphQL schema or GraphQL queries.

- `yarn prisma:migrate`: Creates migration files from your Prisma schema changes and runs those migrations on your local dev db ([docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate)). Run this whenever you change your database schema.

- `yarn prisma:studio`: Starts [Prisma Studio](https://prisma.io/studio) on `localhost:5555` where you can inspect your local development database.

- `yarn cypress:open`: Opens Cypress so you can write and run your end-to-end tests. ([docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#Adding-npm-scripts))

All the others are used in CI or by those three main scripts, but you should only rarely need to run them manually.
